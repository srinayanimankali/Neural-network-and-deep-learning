Part1: A  communications  equipment  manufacturing  company  has  a  product  which  is  responsible  for  emitting  informative  signals.  Company  wants  to  build  a machine learning model which can help the company to predict the equipmentâ€™s signal quality using various parameters.
This project uses a neural network regressor model with SGD optimizer.
Part2: This project develops a digit classifier from the SVHN dataset. The SVHN dataset consists of the images of the house numbers obtained from the Google street view images. The project
builds a digit classifier to identify the prominent street numbers from a provided image. It uses a neural network classifier to identify street numbers from a particular image
